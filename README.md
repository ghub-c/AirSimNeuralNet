# AirSim Machine Learning

This is the repository of my Final Degree Thesis in Machine Learning (as a Telecommunications engineer student) at UPC (Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya).
The main idea is to provide application examples of Machine Learning tools for a drone.


### Prerequisites

The environment needed to run and test the project up to now is:


[AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim)

[Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
